### Hi, welcome to my page!  
My name is Dom (short for Dominck), I’m just a normal guy who likes planners. I’m also an artist and writer, and I’m currently working on a couple of projects.  
But we’re here for planners and journals, so let’s talk about that!  
I like planners not only as a way to organize my life and work, but also as a creative outlet that doesn’t require as much thought as drawing, and because it helps my mental health be more manageable and less of a butt.  
I’ve been into planners and journaling for a couple of years now, but I used to be kinda embarrassed about it. I decided to join this community more actively because I realized that I don’t need to be ashamed or embarrassed of my hobbies and what I like doing. I’m here to tell that negative voice in my head to shut up and let me do whatever I want.  
#I hope you enjoy going through my site or my instagram (@plannerboydom) and most of all have a great day!
