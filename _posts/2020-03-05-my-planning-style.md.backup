title: Don’t be afraid to try new things! This is how my planning style evolved over time

---

### Hi, how are you doing? Welcome to my blog, thank you for coming!   
In this post I want to tell you about how my style of planning evolved since I started out at the end of 2017. I wanted to make this post in the hopes that someone who is struggling with their planner might find it useful in one way or another.  
Like with everything else in life, we all start planning from a different place, with different intentions and different resources. I started out using some printables I found on the internet, I tried many of them, but none of them worked. I ended up with a couple of sheets of paper lying at the bottom of my big pile of notebooks on my desk. What I didn’t realize at the moment was that I was feeling overwhelmed by the written words on the paper. What if I end up not doing all the things I wanted to do today? What if I continue to fail to do what I’ve been trying to do for the past two months? These questions and more where going through my head every time I sat down to write in my loose-leaf planner…  
### I was afraid of committing to doing what I wanted to do, cause I was scared of failing.  
At the time, I had no idea that there was this huge community of planners all over the world, and I thought planners were boring and not worth looking at, so I gave up the idea of planning my tasks and had a very unproductive couple of months that summer. Even if at that time I didn’t have many responsibilities, I couldn’t stop thinking about the future: what was I going to do when I eventually had more responsibilities?  
Things were not so simple at the time, as there was an underlying problem to all of this, one that I had to address before I could be able to be fully productive. And even after I’ve been addressing it for a couple of years it is still difficult to do all the things I want to do, and I have to accept that and be patient with myself. In this case I’m talking about depression and all the other problems that I’m still trying to understand and overcome, but we’ll talk about that some other day.  
A couple of months later, I stumbled across some information about bullet journaling and was immediately captivated by it. A planner that I can pick up at any time? And I also get to design it and keep what works and get rid of what doesn’t? This is awesome! I especially became interested in it after reading all the testimonials of other people that have difficulty focusing like I do. So I looked at all the information I found, grabbed a lined notebook and a pen, and started drawing in the basic pages proposed by Ryder Carroll, the method’s creator.  
I stayed in that notebook for about a month and a half, which was already a lot more than I had ever stated on any planner before, but I eventually realized that organizing a single notebook and keeping it tidy was kinda difficult for me. I didn’t like it when my collections got mixed up with my daily pages, so I decided to try a Traveler’s Notebook style cover with different inserts, DIYed from some cheap leather I found at the local market.

With the two systems combined, I managed to use the Bullet Journal Method for like a year and a half, with some periods of not using them and some periods of using it multiple times a day. Sadly, the day came when I got tired of drawing all the spreads, especially the calendars… I sure do hate drawing calendars, the lines get all mixed up!  
After that, I bought a regular daily agenda, the only kind I can seem to find in my town; the most basic, boring, cheapest one. I fell into the mentality of “I don’t need anything fancy or special, I should be fine with this, I don’t need my planner to be tailored to my specific needs. After all, if everyone else uses simple planners like this one, I should be able to work with one too, right?”  
### Well, no, I was completely wrong about that…

By the end of the first month, I had barely touched that planner at all. I had forgotten WHY I was using the bullet journal method and had instead focused on the how. So I had to remind myself why:
I started using the bullet journal method because I needed an undated planner, because I needed different layouts all in the same place, because if my pages look boring I won’t want to look at it, because I have trouble focusing on what I have in front of me and I need my pages to catch my eye, and if everything looks the same on the page then I won’t be able to tell what’s going on.  
And that’s why at the end of 2019 I grabbed an old traveler’s notebook insert, drew the simplest weekly layout I could think of (copied from the hobonichi weeks) and gave the system another try. I started with that layout so that I wouldn’t overload my days with infinite to-do lists and I would be able to get back into the rhythm of doing things and working on my projects, which had been brought to a full stop by my second hospitalization that month.

  Some time went by and I outgrew that layout, so I got my dad, who’s a graphic designer, to design a printable for me based on the hobonichi cousin weekly layout, since I wanted to try that one next. I also bought a daily insert for six-ring binders that I would use for time blocking and as an extended to-do for each day. Then I put all of that together with a couple of makeshift covers and some MAMBI discs that I had bought when I was living in Chile with my dad.  
This frankenplanner worked great for me, it had the same premise of the one I was using before, where I would use the bullet journal method combined with pre-printed layouts so that I wouldn’t have to draw the same layout over and over every time I wanted to use it. I’m currently away from my favorite kind of paper and my printer, though, so I can’t just print every new layout I come across.

Recently, the back cover of my planner got damaged, so I switched to a personal size six-ring binder I had recently acquired, but the planning method is the same… except I’m back to drawing my own layouts, for two main reasons: 1) I’m trying to adapt the modifications I was making to the old planner’s layouts, mostly the daily one, into something that works well for me, and 2) I hope that in exploring different layouts for different purposes I can find and provide more tools for managing mental health, not only for me, but also for other people who are struggling with problems similar and/or different to mine.  
But I digress. Why did I just tell you all this? I told you what my planning journey has been like so far so that you can see that it’s ok to try new things. Maybe your planner works for you, but you’re not completely happy with it, then change it up a bit! Experiment with new layouts! Most planners are very flexible, from empty daily pages to fully-packed weeklies, you can always add lines, cover up dates, repurpose note sections, etc.  
Finding a planner that works the best for you is difficult, and even once you find one, it isn’t guaranteed that you’ll still like it if your circumstances change. And it can be even more difficult when you know you want to try one layout but that specific planner isn’t available to you, be it because of financial or even geographical limitations; that’s why I would recommend to anyone reading who wants to try a new layout to test it in any piece of paper before buying the planner, that way you can know in advance if you like it and what you like it for.  

That’s pretty much all I had to say on the topic, I hope you enjoyed reading my post! I’ll try to post as regularly as possible.  
## Thanks for reading til the end, have a nice day!
